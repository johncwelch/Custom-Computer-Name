# Custom-Computer-Name
Sample app for giving a mac a custom name based on the serial number and current long user name

So this is a really simple thing that uses a bit of do shell script and some standard additions stuff to pull the serial number, and name for the currently logged-in user to create a customized computer name.

(why doesn't github know how to wrap a line?)

Anyway, the name format it creates is pretty simple: Mac-<serialnumber>-<firstinitial><lastname>

I don't imagine there's a lot of people who need THAT specific kind of name, but it could be a help in doing your own thing.
